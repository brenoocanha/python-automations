# My Python Automation Scripts ðŸ¤–

Welcome to my repository of Python automations!

This is a space where I collect and develop various utility scripts to automate everyday tasks. The main goal of this project is my own learning and deeper understanding of Python by solving small, practical problems.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

Each automation is contained within its own folder. Inside each folder, you will find:
- The source code for the automation.
- A specific `README.md` file with details on what the automation does and how to run it.
- Any other files necessary for the script to function.

## ðŸ’¡ How to Use

To use any of the automations:
1. Navigate into the desired project folder.
2. Follow the installation and execution instructions contained in that folder's `README.md`.

As this is a learning project, I'm always open to suggestions, tips, and best practices. Feel free to explore the code!
